# raspberryPiSite

A website built by Axel Vanherle with Hugo that allows users to submit posts in markdown format. It's designed to run on any host, making it accessible and reliable. With a clean and simple design, users can easily navigate and find what they're looking for, while the robust back-end (you, but for now my raspberry pi 3B) ensures smooth performance.

## Ways to contribute

- By adding any post that you want! It's that simple.
- Fix errors or add minor improvements.

## Rules for submission

- Model submission files after [example.md](example.md). Put them in `content/posts/`.
- Tag it correctly.

## Cloning

When cloning you might need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Submodules (the theme) may not get cloned automatically, this is what I (and maybe you) might need to do.

To clone the source files so you can host this website you need to clone the gh-pages branch. To do this run `git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/axelvanherle/raspberryPiSite.git`.
